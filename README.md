- I did my best to organize and label every change and feature included..
- In `userChrome.css and userContent.css` there's also a descriptions for every file in the Theme.
- You can safely remove certain features if you read the files thoroughly.
- I encourage you to take this theme, gut it, steal it, change certain parts, make it your own.
- Enjoy.
