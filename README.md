# Use the theme
1. Sidebery, simple copy and paste [ chrome/CSS/sidebery.css ] to your Style Editor. (recommended)<br>
1b. [ sb-style-edit.txt ] OR import [ sidebery-data-soulhotel.json ]. (not recommended)<br>

2. User Chrome ✅? [ toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets ] <br>
3. organize Four things on the navigation bar, goto customize toolbar<br>

![img 3 organize](https://github.com/soulhotel/Perfection-Firefox-CSS-Theme/assets/155501797/8a6648e7-c2b6-4570-8bb9-89d316e4fa8f)
4. [ A ] This is Sidebery [ B ] URL Bar next to Sidebery Button, then UBlock Origin (🔒)<br>
4b. Whatever button you put on the right of URL Bar will sit inside of it. Put Bookmark toolbar and then at least 1 flexible space next. The more flexible spaces, the smaller the URL Bar 👍<br>
5. [ C ] This is a (3 in 1) Min Max Close Button Hub. This is my extension.<br>
5b. [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/min-max-close-hub/ ]<br>
5c. Extensions that replace the close button are not forgiving, once you press that ✖️ <br>
you cant confirm first to close a window, this one is forgiving.<br>
5d. [ D ] is the overflow menu - dont worry, its only visible when you are customizing toolbar.<br>
6. Low and behold, this will be your outcome. <br>

7. Above I have my minmaxclosehub, fullscreen bttn, newwindow bttn, and ublock, excluded from the "automatic cleaning" up of the nav bar.<br>
7b. Once I hover over the nav bar, or focus on the URL bar, everything shows itself.<br>

7c. You can adjust the list of buttons to exclude* Its easy to follow just make sure you read the page up and down before you adjust buttons [ chrome/CSS/hide-navbaritems.css ]<br>
8. I did my best to organize and section off the edits that I made.<br>
   
For example, on the NewTab page, I made the buttons less ugly, deleted search bar, and put my chess board picture as a background. Dont like it?

go to [ chrome/WEBSITECSS/newtab-homepage.css ] and delete 3 lines.

You can truly take this theme, gut it, steal certain parts, make it your own, whatevr.
